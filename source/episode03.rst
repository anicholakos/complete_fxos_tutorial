Episode 3: Working with the WebIDE
==================================

Welcome to Episode 3 of the Firefox OS App Development tutorial. This episode
is about digging deeper into the Firefox OS WebIDE and learning how to debug
Firefox OS Apps.


Prerequisites
-------------

* You have setup your machine with the Firefox OS Simulator.  If not you can
  check out :ref:`dev_setup`, which takes you through the entire setup.
* You have install the ``zipcodeapp`` that we covered in :ref:`hello_world`.
  This tutorial uses that as an example, but if you have any other application
  installed in the Firefox WebIDE, then you should be able to follow along. But
  I strongly suggest getting the `zipcodeapp source code from Github
  <https://github.com/jelkner/zipcodeapp>`__, and installing it as discussed
  in the previous episode.


What we shall cover in this Episode
