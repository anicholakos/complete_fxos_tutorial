Overview and Development Setup
==============================

Welcome series of tutorials on getting started with Firefox OS development.

I will assume that the reason you are here is to learn how to write Firefox OS
apps. Well, if you are web developer, I can safely state that you already know
how to write Firefox OS Applications since what the Firefox OS device runs are
web applications.

There is enough material on the web available on the history of Firefox OS, the 
reasons for its existence, the devices that currently run the OS and more. I
will not get into those details but briefly touch upon them so that we are on
the same page. If you want to know more about why I want Firefox OS to succeed, 
here is my blog post titled `Firefox OS â€“ The Mobile Platform That Needs To
Succeed
<http://rominirani.com/2013/07/23/firefox-os-the-mobile-web-platform-that-needs-to-succeed/>`__

What is Firefox OS? A Quick Overview Please!
--------------------------------------------

As with many things of this nature, it is a very good idea to start with
the `Firefox OS Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS>`__ to
get a broad overview of what Firefox is and how it came to be.

Current list of devices support Firefox OS
------------------------------------------

The mobile phone space is rapidly changing.  For a current list of the
countries where Firefox OS phones can be purchased and which vendors sell them
see `this page <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/>`__.

What do I need to learn?
------------------------

Chances are that if you are web developer, you know everything there is to
building Firefox OS Apps. Use all the tools/frameworks that the Web provides
and it should work well. Remember these are days of infancy for Firefox OS, so
do expect hiccups along the way.

Developing for Firefox OS means developing for the Web. You will need to be
comfortable with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript language. That is the bare minimum
you will need to know. The better you are at it, the easier it will be. Since
Firefox runs Web applications, you can use all the cool JavaScript
frameworks/libraries that you are used to. Nothing prevents you from using
that.

Along the way, I shall try and cover some of the HTML5 JavaScript APIs but I
strongly suggest that you be comfortable with basic Web technologies like
HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Code Academy has some great tutorials (`HTML/CSS
<http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web>`__ and `JavaScript
<http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript>`__), if you want to learn about
them.

Is there a Firefox Marketplace?
-------------------------------

Yes, there is a Firefox Marketplace for your apps. This is one similar lines
to the ones for other Vendors and if you are familiar with the submission
process for them, you will find this no different.

Few things to note here:

* There is no one-time registration fee or yearly fee for being a publisher on
  the Firefox Marketplace.
* You can have both paid and free applications.
* There is a review process after you submit your applications and on approval,
  it is listed as available in the Marketplace.

We shall cover the complete process of submitting your Firefox OS application
to the Marketplace in a future episode. This will suffice for now.
