Episode 9: Device Storage
=========================

Welcome to Episode 9 of the Firefox OS App Development Tutorial. In the
previous episode, we looked at how you can use Web Activities in your Firefox
OS Applications. In this episode, we shall look at how you can access Device
Storage in your Firefox OS Apps. By Device Storage, we will see how to browse
through the content on your SD Card, Pictures, Videos and Music areas on your
phone.


Prerequisites
-------------

* You have setup your machine with the Firefox OS Simulator.  If not you can
  check out :ref:`dev_setup`, which takes you through the entire setup.
* You have a basic understanding of writing Firefox OS Apps.  If not, I
  strongly suggest refering to earlier episodes, especially :ref:`hello_world`,
  that covers how to write your first Firefox OS App.


What this Episode covers 
------------------------

* `Device Storage
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Device_Storage_API>`__ and
  how to use the Device Storage APIs.
* Sample Firefox OS Application that covers how to access Device Storage.

trying to do here.
