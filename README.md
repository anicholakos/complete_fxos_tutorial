# Firefox OS App Development Tutorial

by Romin Irani and Sotirios Nicholakos 

This is a derivative of Romin Irani's blog tutorial,
[Firefox OS â€“ The Mobile Web Platform That Needs To Succeed](http://rominirani.com/2013/07/23/firefox-os-the-mobile-web-platform-that-needs-to-succeed/).

It has been converted to Sphinx Python documentation format and updated to
reflect changes to the FXOS app development environment since the posts were
written.
